Table: Cinema

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| id             | int      |
| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |
+----------------+----------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.*/

SELECT * 
FROM Cinema
WHERE description != "boring" AND MOD(id, 2) <> 0
-- WHERE description != "boring" AND id % 2 <> 0
ORDER BY rating DESC;

| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 

Table: UnitsSold

+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 

Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |

+------------+---------------+
Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96*/

| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |

| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
Explanation: 
Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33*/
