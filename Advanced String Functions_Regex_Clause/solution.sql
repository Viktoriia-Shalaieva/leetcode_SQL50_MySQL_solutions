1667. Fix Names in a Table
Table: Users

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.
 

Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |
+---------+-------+
Output: 
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
+---------+-------+
*/

1527. Patients With a Condition
Table: Patients

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| patient_id   | int     |
| patient_name | varchar |
| conditions   | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
patient_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
'conditions' contains 0 or more code separated by spaces. 
This table contains information of the patients in the hospital.
 

Write a solution to find the patient_id, patient_name, and conditions of the patients who have Type I Diabetes. Type I Diabetes always starts with DIAB1 prefix.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Patients table:
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 1          | Daniel       | YFEV COUGH   |
| 2          | Alice        |              |
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
| 5          | Alain        | DIAB201      |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 | 
+------------+--------------+--------------+
Explanation: Bob and George both have a condition that starts with DIAB1.

 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT id,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS row_num

    SELECT id FROM CTE WHERE row_num > 1
);
